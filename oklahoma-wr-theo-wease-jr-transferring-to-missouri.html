Comparing last year with this one, much of the transfer portal heat is tied to high-profile coaching changes, but we haven’t seen many of those so far.</p><p>So the portal is light on easily recognizable names right now. The transfer window stays open until Jan. 18. There are some players, though, who will step into new situations next season with important chapters left to write before trying their hands at the next level. Even with warts in their tape, there is reason for at least a little optimism over their chances at getting an NFL shot.</p><p>That’s especially true of the quarterbacks on the move. Let’s take a look at five of the most interesting transfer-portal options at that position, as well as a few other names to remember.</p><p><a href=#>Read more here.</a></p><a href=# data-amp-replace=CLIENT_ID class="sc-f3dd6d06-16 jkrWUg" readability=1><p class="sc-f3dd6d06-18 jMggnu">GO FURTHER</p><p class="sc-f3dd6d06-19 gXOwpd">NFL Draft 2024: DJ Uiagalelei and other transfer portal QB prospects to watch</p></a><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">2022 All-Portal Team, from Caleb Williams to Xazavian Valladay</h2><span><span></span><img alt="2022 All-Portal Team, from Caleb Williams to Xazavian Valladay" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As coaching staffs across the country compete for the more than 1,000 players who entered the NCAA transfer portal this week, here’s a reminder of why those efforts matter so much. It’s time for The Athletic’s second annual All-Portal Team.</p><p>Just like our 2021 squad, this group is loaded with All-America and all-conference performers who came from a variety of backgrounds and previous stops. The All-Portal Team recognizes the transfer players who were most productive on their new teams and most impactful for this college football season. Only newcomers who joined their current program in 2022 were eligible to make this list.</p><p>Many of these players were much-hyped when they hit the portal during the 2021-22 cycle, but this team also features a bunch of surprise standouts. These picks are never easy, especially when you consider how many players transferred this year, and many more players merit recognition.
