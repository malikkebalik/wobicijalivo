The 24-year-old rapper got major buzz in 2020 for the song “Whats Poppin’,” which hit number two on the Billboard Music Charts. He also gained more popularity after his first-ever appearance on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Saturday Night Live </a>in March 2021, alongside host and former SNL&nbsp;cast member <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Maya Rudolph</strong></a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Jack is also going to be seen on tons of TVs on Thanksgiving 2023, as he performs the halftime show for the Detroit Lions game against the Green Bay Packers. The Lions have hosted a Thanksgiving game every&nbsp; year since 1934, so Jack is participating in a major tradition. Ahead of the game, the rapper has made appearances on the team’s social media and&nbsp;Monday Night Football,&nbsp;per&nbsp;Billboard.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>This isn’t the first time that Jack has gotten involved in the NFL. The musician starred in a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Super Bowl commercial</a> with&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Missy Elliot</strong></a>, back in February. The ad is for the chip brand Doritos and shows Jack exploring a “new angle” and flavor. In <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the commercial</a> (<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>watch here</a>), the “Way Out” rapper began using an instrument, a triangle, reminiscent of the tortilla chip shape. Amid the star’s rising success here for six things to know about him!</p><h2>Jack Harlow’s Song ‘First Class’ Is His Biggest Hit</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>As previously mentioned, Jack’s most popular song is “First Class” which is a track from his 2020 album Come Home The Kids Miss You.&nbsp;The music video for the song already has over 79 million views and counting on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>YouTube</a>! Interestingly, the track riffs off of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Fergie</strong></a>‘s “<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Glamorous</a>” track ft. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ludacris</strong></a>. Although the song is not exactly the same, it does feature the blonde beauty’s famous lyrics “First class… up in the sky.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Another hit of his is his 2020 track “What’s Poppin’,” feat. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Dababy</strong></a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tory Lanez</strong></a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lil Wayne</strong></a> which was accompanied by a <strong>Lyrical Lemonade</strong> a.ka. <strong>Cole Bennett</strong> directed music video. The song ended up hitting number two on the Billboard Hot 100, and also got him a Grammy nomination in the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Best Rap Performance category</a> (the Grammy went to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Megan Thee Stallion</strong></a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Beyoncé</strong></a> for “Savage”). “It’s never felt like this before. The validation is flying in every day. Every day I’m waking up to good news. The song is changing my life man, I’m happy,” he said to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sniffers</a>.</p><h2>Jack Harlow’s Dating History</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Since his rise to fame Jack has been <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>romantically linked</a> to pop sensation&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Dua Lipa</strong></a>. The two first met at the Variety Hitmakers Brunch in Los Angeles in Nov. 2022, per a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six</a> insider. The source even claimed that, “he was very interested in her, and was going to strongly pursue [the romance].” It’s no surprise that Jack had <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the feels for Dua</a>, as he even named a song after her on his 2020 album! Some of the lyrics include: “Dua Lipa, I’m tryna do more with her than do a feature (do it).” So cheeky!</p><h2>Jack Harlow Was Bullied Over His Eye Condition</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>In a 2017 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Louisville</a>&nbsp;Jack opened up about bullying her faced growing up with a lazy eye. The outlet reported that through kindergarten he had to wear an eyepatch over his right eye to help make his other eye stronger. He revealed that he was known as a “nerd” and it had an affect on him throughout his life. “It affects me to this day. Not in a dramatic, been-through-a-lot way, but in how I use humor to interact with people,” Jack told the outlet at the time.</p><h2>Jack Harlow’s KFC Meal Went Viral</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>In June 2022 the up-and-coming rapper collaborated with the fast-food chain KFC to create his <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>own meal</a>. It was only a matter of time until the popular chicken sandwich meal went viral. “From releasing ‘Come Home the Kids Miss You’ and now launching my own meal at KFC, I’m having a super blessed summer,” he said via KFC’s <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>press release</a> at the time. “When KFC asked me to create my own meal, I knew it couldn’t be just any meal. My meal brings together my childhood favorites from growing up in Louisville, the KFC Mac & Cheese, with my new go-to Spicy Chicken Sandwich (with plenty of ranch), Secret Recipe Fries, and lemonade – it doesn’t get much better.”</p><h2>Jack Harlow’s From Kentucky but Lives in Atlanta</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Jack Harlow was born on March 13, 1998 to parents <strong>Maggie</strong> and <strong>Brian Harlow</strong>, who are of French and Irish heritage. He was born in Louisville, Kentucky and later moved to Shelbyville, where he grew up on a horse farm. It was in his home state where he became a hip hop fan through his mom, who had <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Eminem</strong></a>‘s The Marshall Mathers&nbsp;on repeat. “She told me all the words I was about to hear but wasn’t allowed to say,” he said to GQ in Dec. 2020, also remembering going to the store to buy a album.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Jack moved to Atlanta, Georgia in 2017 — which has been a whole new source of inspiration for his music. Since living there, he’s worked with legends like <strong>DJ Drama</strong> and <strong>Don Cannon</strong>, who signed him to their label. “I’m doing a much better job of representing who I am off record, on record,” he said of the move. “I don’t know if [credibility] is a requirement to have success, but it’s important to me,” he said to GQ. “When I was shopping around before I signed I wasn’t like, ‘I’m not signing until I find some Black gatekeepers.’ But I’m proud to be signed to them,” he added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/who-is-Jack-Harlow-shutterstock-post.jpg><h2>Jack Harlow’s Been Nominated for Six Grammys</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>Jack has been nominated for a total of six <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Grammy Awards</a> during his career.
