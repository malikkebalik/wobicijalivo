<time>27 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><h2>Wiki Biography</h2><p>John Angelo Gotti III, also known by his nickname “Junior” Gotti, was born on the 14th February 1964, inQueens, New York City USA of Italian(father) and Russian(mother) ancestry. He is best known for being a former mobster and captain of the Gambino crime family from 1992 until 1999, and eventually accused of racketeering. He is also recognized as a businessman.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich John Gotti Jr. is, as of early 2016? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that the overall size of John’s net worth is currently equal to $10 million, which has been accumulated through his involvement in organized crime as a mobster and boss of an American crime family.<br>[divider]</p><h3>John Gotti, Jr. Net Worth $10 Million</h3><p>[divider]<br>John Gotti, Jr. was raised with four siblings in the Italian area of Howard Beach, Queens, by John Joseph Gotti, Sr. and his wife <a href=#>Victoria DiGiorgio Gotti</a>. His father was also a mobster and the boss of the Gambino crime family. John went to New York Military Academy in Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York; however, he didn’t graduate, as he quit education to start the family trucking business – the Samson Trucking Company. The business soon failed however, and he began to gain position in the Carpenters Union, but in no time his priority became to follow his father’s steps and step into the criminal hierarchy.</p><p>John`s ‘career’ began in 1988, when he became a part of the Gambino crime family. Little by little he progressed, and two years later, he was named as the caporegime of the family, which became the main source of his net worth in the following years. Until 1999, John served as the boss of the family, since his father sentenced to life in jail in 1992. After his father was imprisoned, Gotti, became more careful about his operations, and collaborated with trusted members of the family. However, after several years of his allegedly largely incompetent reign, John was arrested and sentenced to 77 months in prison on several counts of racketeering, but he pleaded guilty so the indictment was reduced to loansharking, extortion, and bookmaking. He was released in 2004, but supposedly never returned to organized crime, although several new prosecutions were brought against John, however, all ended in mistrials.</p><p>To speak of his accomplishments, John became the youngest caporegime of the Gambino family, but he was considered as incompetent by several other mafia families, including the Genovese family, who decided that it was better to not cooperate with him. After he was sentenced, his uncle Peter, took over the family ‘business’. John is believed to have co-operated extensively with the FBI in several mafia-related investigations.</p><p>Additional to his career in crime, a number of producers were interested in making a film about John’s life, entitled “Gotti: in the Shadow of My Father” and which will be directed by Joe Johnston.</p><p>When it comes to his personal life, since 1990 John Gotti, Jr. has been married to Kimberly Albanese, who is a daughter of Phillip Albanese, another Gambino crime family mobster. The couple has six children and currently resides in Oyster Bay Cove, The North Shore of Long Island.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=6.9014084507042><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>John Gotti</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$10 million dollars</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>October 27, 1940</td></tr><tr><td>Died</td><td>June 10, 2002</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.78&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Mafioso</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>Franklin K.
