PewDewPie is first on our list of the top 10 richest gamers in the world.</p><p>Online, Kjellberg’s content was already well known for its divisive reaction among broad audiences, but in the late 2010s, it gained further notoriety and came under more intense media scrutiny.</p><p>Kjellberg was surpassed as the most subscribed YouTube channel in 2019 in a public rivalry with the Indian musical company T-Series.</p><p>Soon after, videos about Minecraft started to gain popularity and become part of his video library.
