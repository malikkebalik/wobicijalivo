Ohio Attorney General <strong>Dave Yost </strong>and Guernsey County Sheriff <strong>Jeffrey D. Paden </strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>announced</a> on Wednesday (Feb. 1) that Sills, 25, was indicted on one count of rape and one count of kidnapping, both first-degree felonies. The indictment, according to the Guernsey County Sheriff Department’s website, alleges that Sills engaged in a sexual activity that was “not consensual” in December 2019, and he allegedly held the unnamed person against her will.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The alleged victim reported the incident immediately, and the Guernsey County Sheriff’s Department “conducted a detailed investigation.” Afterward, the case was presented to a Guernsey County Common Please Court grand jury and is now being prosecuted by the Special Prosecutions section of Attorney General Dave Yost’s office. Sills was issued a summons to appear before a court on Feb. 16, four days after his team, the Philadelphia Eagles, play the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LVII (Feb. 12).</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>Update 1:31 pm ET: </strong>The Eagles issued a statement to <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>: “The organization is aware of the legal matter involving Josh Sills. We have been in communication with the league office and are in the process of gathering more information. We have no further comment at this time.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>As the issue unfolds, here’s what you need to know about Josh Sills.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Josh-Sills-5-Things-Eagles-SS-embed-1.jpg><h2>Josh Sills Is An American Football Player</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Joshua Matthew Sills (b. Jan. 26, 1998) grew up in Sarahsville, Ohio, attending Meadowbrook High School before attending West Virginia University. In 2020, he transferred to Oklahoma State University. He declared for the NFL Draft in 2022, went unselected, and was later signed by the Eagles as an undrafted free agent.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Sills is listed as a second-string right guard. He only played one game as a rookie, a week five matchup with the Arizona Cardinals.</p><h2>Josh Sills Spent His Highschool On A Farm</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>“I worked with my high school agriculture teacher on his farm,” Josh told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>NBC Sports</a>. “I planted corn, fed cows, vaccinated cows, artificially inseminated cows. Normal everyday farm stuff. I basically did my internship with him. We just normal farm stuff, built a fence, vaccinated cattle, planted corn, mowed hay, baled hay. That was really about it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“I knew him,” Sills added. “He actually went to school with my mom’s brother, my uncle, so I knew him a little bit before then and just became really good friends with him. I asked him if he would be comfortable with me doing an internship with him. Of course, he said yes. I did my internship with him over the summer, so it was probably a couple months.”</p><h2>He Pursued Agriculture In College</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>“The big thing for me is I have my undergrad in agribusiness management, and OSU here, they have one of the top 10, top 15 ag schools in the country,” Josh told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sports Illustrated</a> in 2020. “But the other big thing that I noticed right off the bat, just from talking on the phone with coach Gundy, coach Dickey, coach (Rob) Glass, coach (Kasey) Dunn, and those guys is they were people that I wanted to be around.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Josh-Sills-5-Things-Eagles-SS-embed-2.jpg><h2><strong>He Credits His Parents For His Success</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>“I think the biggest thing that has kind of helped me is I enjoy hard work,” Sills told SI. “My dad, both my parents, instilled that into me at a young age. We didn’t always have the best things or the nicest things, but they would make sure that my sister and I would have what we needed. Seeing that, and being around that, just kind of helped shape be into the person that I am today.”</p><h2><strong>His Parents Are His Biggest Fans</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>In 2021, Josh’s parents, <strong>John </strong>and <strong>Kimm Sills</strong>, told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Oklahoman</a> that they put more than 232,000 miles on their 2013 Nissan Altima from traveling to every one of Josh’s football games. “It’s huge,” Josh said about his parents’ commitment to seeing him play. “I don’t really know how to explain it. There’s not enough words to describe what that means to me, just the love, willingness, caringness, and compassion that they have is unreal.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K3sL%2FHZqqipJyoenZ8kHJvbWtf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feagles-player-indicted-on-rape-kidnapping-charges-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2feagles-player-indicted-on-rape-kidnapping-charges-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2feagles-player-indicted-on-rape-kidnapping-charges-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2feagles-player-indicted-on-rape-kidnapping-charges-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feagles-player-indicted-on-rape-kidnapping-charges-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2feagles-player-indicted-on-rape-kidnapping-charges-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-91-year-old-supermodel-carmen-dell-orefice-battled-bankruptcy-and-dodgy-husbands-to-emerge-trium.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-91-year-old-supermodel-carmen-dell-orefice-battled-bankruptcy-and-dodgy-husbands-to-emerge-trium.html>How 91-year-old supermodel Carmen Dell'Orefice battled bankruptcy and dodgy husbands to emerge trium</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./coco-quinn-bio-wiki.html>Coco Quinn Bio (Wiki)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./coco-quinn-bio-wiki.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
