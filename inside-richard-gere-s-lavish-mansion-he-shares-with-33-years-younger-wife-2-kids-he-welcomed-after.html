After two divorces, he eventually found love with a woman 33 years younger and became a father later in life.</p><p class=dh>Richard Gere was the '80s and '90s Hollywood heartthrob, while Cindy Crawford was an acclaimed supermodel. When they met back in 1988 at a star-studded barbecue, Crawford was inevitably taken with the actor's charming ways.</p><p class=dh>They married four years later in Las Vegas, where they surprisingly exchanged aluminum foil rings. Unfortunately, only four years into the revered union, the two separated. People began speculating that they got divorced because they were both gay.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/832226818c6dd1a6181e0c3d0508b51a.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Richard Gere and Cindy Crawford | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>The rumors claimed that the two married as a publicity stunt to hide their sexuality.
