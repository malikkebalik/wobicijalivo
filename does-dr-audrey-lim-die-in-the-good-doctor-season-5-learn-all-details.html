That is not to say that we will lose her. We adore her. But there will be difficulties ahead.”</p><p>He went on to say that he and Chang had already discussed Dr. Lim’s fate and that the actor is “excited” about what’s to come.</p><p>“Look, I think actors are concerned about their jobs on some level, but they also want juicy stuff to deal with,” Shore told the publication.</p><p>While Shore did not say whether Dr. Lim would survive the attack, he did say that he and the show’s writing team were interested in “challenging her physically,” which could imply that the character will return for Season 6.</p><h2><strong>Review of The Good Doctor Season 5 Episode 18</strong></h2><p>Season finales are almost always cliffhangers, but did we really need to end with Dr. Lim and Nurse Villanueva bleeding out on the floor?</p><p>It’s not surprising that Owen assaulted his ex-girlfriend. He was verbally abusing her and knew where she worked.</p><p>Unfortunately, when the abused partner decides to leave, abuse often escalates into violence, sometimes fatally.</p><p>While it was not Lim’s fault that Owen attacked Villanueva at the hospital, I wish someone had thought about it and increased security. I also wish we hadn’t ended the season with two women bleeding out on the floor.</p><h2><strong>Where to watch Good Doctor</strong></h2><p>You can watch Good Doctor all season on Hulu and Amazon Prime.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>‘Julia’ Renewed for Season 2 at HBO Max: Potential Release Date 2023 And Everything We Know So Far</a></li><li><a href=#>Ncis Season 19 Episode 20 Release Date, Spoiler, Recap, And When Is It Coming Out?</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmru1sdGtmKKmnZq7tXvDqJysZZSneqLBw6ucsmWcnrpusMieZKKmXam1pnnGqKadZZSksLW70WaqnpmjpLtugYylnJqqnmKurbiMnZytmZmhwHA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdoes-dr-audrey-lim-die-in-the-good-doctor-season-5-learn-all-details.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdoes-dr-audrey-lim-die-in-the-good-doctor-season-5-learn-all-details.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdoes-dr-audrey-lim-die-in-the-good-doctor-season-5-learn-all-details.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdoes-dr-audrey-lim-die-in-the-good-doctor-season-5-learn-all-details.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdoes-dr-audrey-lim-die-in-the-good-doctor-season-5-learn-all-details.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-dr-audrey-lim-die-in-the-good-doctor-season-5-learn-all-details.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./hear-mad-butcher-ed-gein-s-voice-for-first-time-in-new-docuseries.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./hear-mad-butcher-ed-gein-s-voice-for-first-time-in-new-docuseries.html>Hear 'Mad Butcher' Ed Gein's voice for first time in new docuseries</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./todd-chrisley-gives-candid-reply-to-daughter-lindsie-chrisley-s-recent-claim-that-he-is-not-her-biol.html>Todd Chrisley Gives Candid Reply to Daughter Lindsie Chrisley's Recent Claim That He Is Not Her Biol</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./todd-chrisley-gives-candid-reply-to-daughter-lindsie-chrisley-s-recent-claim-that-he-is-not-her-biol.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
