<time>22 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>In the third installment of the Lupin series, Assane Diop, the charismatic gentleman thief played by Omar Sy, embarks on his most audacious adventure yet.</p><p>He orchestrates an elaborate vanishing act while successfully pilfering the famous and invaluable Black Pearl right from under the nose of the police.</p><p>However, Assane’s meticulously laid plans are disrupted by the appearance of a new adversary who resurfaces an important figure from Assane’s past.</p><p>At the conclusion of Part 3, a mysterious figure within the prison piques our curiosity. Assane, incarcerated, finds himself serving time alongside none other than his longtime nemesis, Hubert Pellegrini.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Assane’s Audacious Heist and New Adversary</strong></h2><p>The character of Mariama is introduced in Part 3 as Assane’s mother. While the fate of Assane’s father is known—he was framed by Pellegrini and perished in prison during the 1990s—very little is known about his mother.</p><p>It is revealed that she remained in Senegal while Assane and his father emigrated. Her efforts to join her family in France were thwarted when her employer unjustly reduced her wages.</p><p>In a desperate turn of events, she turned to a life of crime. After 25 years, she finally arrives in Paris, only to be kidnapped.</p><p>Assane’s audacious attempt to steal the Black Pearl, a priceless jewel from the Franco-Tahitian war, serves as a central plot point. This daring heist was one of Assane’s rare failures back in 2017 when he was apprehended during the attempt.</p><p>However, in Part 3, he devises a new plan. He boldly notifies the jewel’s owners of his intentions and even leaks his elaborate scheme to the press.</p><p>This move garners support from citizens who assemble outside the location of the Black Pearl to cheer him on.</p><p>Assane assumes the guise of one of the police officers guarding the pearl, ultimately executing a breathtaking heist and a daring escape that unfolds on the rooftops of Paris, witnessed by a captivated audience.</p><p>Assane resorts to faking his own death as a means to escape the relentless media scrutiny aimed at his ex-partner Claire and his son Raoul.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/peepswiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lupin-Part-3-Ending-Explained-1024x576.jpg><p>With the assistance of Benjamin, posing as a doctor performing his autopsy, Assane leaks a photograph of his supposedly lifeless body and goes as far as being buried alive, complete with a trap door in the coffin.</p><p>His intent is to gather as many witnesses as possible to his demise and burial, although some of those closest to him remain skeptical about his actual fate.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Jean-Luc Keller’s Revenge and Assane’s Sacrifice</strong></h2><p>The character Jean-Luc Keller, Assane’s former mentor, makes a return in Part 3. He once operated a boxing gym frequented by young Assane and Bruno in the 1990s.</p><p>Keller, a figure akin to Fagin from “Oliver Twist,” coerced his vulnerable young protégés into a life of crime, which eventually led to his 25-year imprisonment following a heist gone awry.</p><p>Upon his release, Keller seeks revenge and kidnaps Assane’s mother to inflict the utmost pain on his former ward.</p><p>Keller uses Mariama as leverage, forcing Assane to engage in a series of progressively challenging heists, including stealing Manet’s Chez Tortoni, a valuable gem-studded bracelet, and selling the Black Pearl, despite the world now knowing the identity of the thief.</p><p>As Assane unravels the identity of his blackmailer and devises a plan to thwart the extortion, he strives to save his mother.</p><p>While Assane intends to reveal his continued existence to his family and lead them to a peaceful life in the countryside, he becomes entangled in the crisis of his mother’s abduction and the subsequent blackmail.</p><p>While his son Raoul maintains faith in his father’s survival, Claire, his wife, remains skeptical.</p><p>Claire ultimately uncovers the truth from Benjamin, who has been captured during the bracelet heist.</p><p>She eventually recognizes that Assane has been covertly checking in on her and Raoul, adopting prosthetic disguises to pose as Raoul’s new basketball coach, Alex.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Boston Connection and Detective Guedira’s Assistance</strong></h2><p>A link between the Lupin series and a famous art heist in Boston is uncovered when Assane’s blackmailer instructs him to steal Chez Tortoni from a French mobster’s mother’s residence.</p><p>Assane recalls that the Manet painting was stolen in 1990 in Boston.</p><p>This reference is made to the real-life unsolved robbery of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, chronicled in the series “This Is a Robbery: The World’s Biggest Art Heist.”</p><p>The painting’s connection to France raises intriguing questions about its whereabouts over the years.</p><p>Assane recruits Detective Youssef Guedira, a Paris detective who has been obsessed with catching him.</p><p>Youssef was instrumental in deducing that Assane drew inspiration from Arsène Lupin, a character from Maurice Leblanc’s novels.</p><p>Although Lieutenant Sofia Belkacem is officially in charge of the case, Youssef’s relentless pursuit of Assane leads to his dismissal from the investigation.</p><p>His obsession with Assane is so consuming that Assane tracks him down, seeking his assistance in capturing Keller. Assane promises to turn himself in once his mother is safe.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>A Calculated Surrender, Assane’s Bold Decision</strong></h2><p>Assane’s decision to turn himself in is not a consequence of getting caught; rather, it is a calculated choice he makes to ensure the freedom and safety of his family, including his mother, wife, son, and best friend.</p><p>After guiding Belkacem and Guedira to Keller’s location, Assane steps out of the shadows and surrenders.</p><p>He imposes conditions that include Benjamin’s release, the opportunity to explain his decision to Claire, and the provision of a comprehensive set of Arsène Lupin books for his prison cell.</p><p>The authorities agree to these terms, and Part 3 concludes with Assane behind bars, albeit temporarily.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolZq9tMPIs2Wcp51kwbd7y66noqZdpa6zwIxsZJ6mlJ67qHnEsaelmZmjsqV7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-lupin-part-3-ending-explained-a-mother-s-story-robberies-and-selfless-surrender.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-lupin-part-3-ending-explained-a-mother-s-story-robberies-and-selfless-surrender.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-lupin-part-3-ending-explained-a-mother-s-story-robberies-and-selfless-surrender.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-lupin-part-3-ending-explained-a-mother-s-story-robberies-and-selfless-surrender.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-lupin-part-3-ending-explained-a-mother-s-story-robberies-and-selfless-surrender.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-lupin-part-3-ending-explained-a-mother-s-story-robberies-and-selfless-surrender.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./yg-marley-siblings-from-football-fields-to-fashion-week.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./yg-marley-siblings-from-football-fields-to-fashion-week.html>YG Marley Siblings: From Football Fields to Fashion Week</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./see-his-message-hollywood-life.html>See His Message Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./see-his-message-hollywood-life.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
