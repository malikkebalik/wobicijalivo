The lyrics begin with the couple passing in a hall going to separate rooms, with the only conversation piece being the monthly bills that are due. They go to work, go to church, and put on a façade of leading the perfect life, but everything is a lie. The singer declares that they have reached a point where they no longer care and have cried all their tears.</p><br><p>The song's chorus, "We can just go on like this, say the word, we'll call it quits, baby, you can go or you can stay, but I won't love you either way," speaks volumes as it shows that the love they had for each other had faded away. They are going through the motions of a relationship, yet both are secretly miserable, knowing that their love had evaporated into nothing.</p><br><p>Towards the end of the song, the singer realizes that, although it has been hard, their hearts can only take so much. They are at a crossroads where it's time to make a decision to separate for good or try to find a way to rediscover the love they once shared. The song's melancholic tune and honest lyrics truly capture the pain and sorrow of this situation.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>We pass in the hall on our way to separate rooms</u><br>We are no longer close and do not interact as we once did, living separate lives under the same roof.</p><br><p><u>The only time we ever talk is when the monthly bills are due</u><br>Our communication is limited to mundane tasks, and we don't have significant conversations anymore.</p><br><p><u>We go to work, we go to church</u><br>We adhere to social expectations of what a good life is supposed to look like, but it's not fulfilling.</p><br><p><u>We fake the perfect life</u><br>We pretend that everything is fine, that we're happy and content, but it's a facade.</p><br><p><u>I'm passed the point of giving a damn</u><br>I've stopped caring about trying to fix things or going through the motions of pretending everything is okay.</p><br><p><u>And all my tears are cried</u><br>I've reached a point where I can no longer cry or express my emotions because it's all been exhausted.</p><br><p><u>It's been so long since I've felt anything inside these walls</u><br>Our relationship is dead, and I no longer feel any emotions towards my partner, only numbness.</p><br><p><u>You can't hate and you can't hurt / When you don't feel at all</u><br>The lack of emotions has made it impossible to have negative ones, either towards my partner or myself.</p><br><p><u>I used to cry and stay up nights / And wonder what went wrong</u><br>I used to feel pain and sadness about the decline of our relationship, trying to figure out where things went wrong.</p><br><p><u>And it's been hard / But hearts can only do that for so long</u><br>It's been a difficult journey to get to where we are, but eventually, a heart can only take so much before it becomes numb.</p><br><p><u>We can just go on like this / Say the word, we'll call it quits / Baby, you can go or you can stay / But I won't love you either way</u><br>We can continue living life as we are, but there's no love between us anymore, and it would be better to end things.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Ultra Tunes, BMG Rights Management, Warner Chappell Music, Inc.<br>Written by: Kendell Wayne Marvel, Timothy A.
