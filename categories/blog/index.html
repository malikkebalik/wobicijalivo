The tribunal however found that the items were taxable, hence KRA was right in demanding the amount.
“This therefore leaves room for one reasonable conclusion; that the appellant (RVR) was not granted remission in respect of the locomotives and as such the taxes as assessed by the respondent (KRA) are properly due and payable by the appellant,” the Tribunal ruled.</p><footer><a href=../../rift-valley-railways-ordered-to-pay-kra-ksh1-6-billion-in-taxes.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../coco-quinn-bio-wiki.html>Coco Quinn Bio (Wiki)</a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>
