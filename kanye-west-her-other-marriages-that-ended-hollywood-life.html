The&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> star and her husband of nearly seven years,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kanye West</strong></a>, decided to go their separate ways in Feb. 2020. Kim filed for divorce, and the two have been separated ever since. In the months that followed, Kim and Kanye have both stayed pretty tight-lipped about the split, although it’s very much played out in the public eye.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Sadly, Kim is no stranger to dealing with divorce, as she’s already been through the ringer twice when it comes to her past marriages. Kim is also divorced from her first husband,&nbsp;<strong>Damon Thomas</strong>, and her second husband,<strong> Kris Humphries</strong>, who she was only married to for 72 days before filing in 2011. As Kim prepares to delve more into her past relationships on the&nbsp;Keeping Up With the Kardashians reunion, here’s more to know about her three marriages.</p><h2><strong>Kim Kardashian’s Divorce From Kanye West</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kim-Kardashian-and-kanye-west-mega-embed-2.jpg>News broke that Kim had officially <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> from Kanye on February 19. Details of the former A-list couple’s divorce quickly became clearer as more information became available. Kim requested joint physical and legal custody of the couple’s four children —&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>North West</strong></a>, 8, <a href=#><strong>Saint West</strong></a>, 5,&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Chicago West</strong></a>, 3, and&nbsp;<strong>Psalm West</strong>, 2. The split was also reportedly “amicable” between the two stars. Neither Kim nor Kanye contested the prenup that they signed prior to their May 2014 marriage.<p id=content-paragraph-5>In the weeks leading up to the official divorce filing, both Kim and Kanye maneuvered a slew of reports that implicated the end of their marriage was imminent. On January 5, reports circulated that Kim<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> was “done” with the couple’s marriage</a>, and in the time afterward, Kanye reportedly began <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>moving items out of the couple’s home</a>. During summer 2020, there was also extreme tension between the two after Kanye publicly claimed that he and Kim almost aborted their first child, North, before she was born. A series of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Twitter rants</a> about Kim followed. However, Kim flew to Wyoming to make things right, and they spent the next several months working on the relationship. Unfortunately, it wasn’t enough.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Although not yet officially divorced, Kim began dating Pete Davidson in Oct. 2021 after meeting on&nbsp;Saturday Night Live. Ye publicly tried to get her back amid the new romance, begging her to “run right back” to him during a charity concert with <strong>Drake</strong> in Dec. 2021, however, the move instead prompted Kim to file to become “legally single” while they worked out the divorce pertaining to their kids, business assets and properties.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>By early 2022, Ye was not thrilled about Kim’s public romance with Pete, posting a series of reactions on Instagram, and taunting Pete by calling him “Skete.” Although Kim and Pete seemed serious and happy, the pair split after nine months together — seemingly affected by the long distance nature of their relationship as Pete <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>worked on a film in Australia</a>.</p><h2><strong>Kim & Kanye’s Divorce Takes Dramatic Turn</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Kim and Kanye seemed to be handling co-parenting and legal matters well during the early stages of their divorce but things took an ugly turn once the SKIMS founder started dating&nbsp;Saturday Night Live actor <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Pete Davidson.</a>&nbsp;</strong>He took to social media and aired out all the dirty laundry of his and Kim’s relationship. He alleged Kim accused him of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>stealing and doing drugs</a> and was ultimately trying to keep him away from their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>four children</a> as he wasn’t invited to Chicago’s fourth birthday and implied that security prevented him from picking up his kids from school. He also lashed out about Kim’s parenting style, slamming her for allowing their eight-year-old daughter to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wear makeup</a> on TikTok. After that, he had “faith” that the two would somehow <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>get back together.</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>He also came for Kim’s&nbsp;SNL&nbsp;boyfriend on social media, accusing Pete of calling him <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mentally ill</a> on the late-night comedy show and leaking <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>private texts</a> from the comedian. In the texts, Pete seemed to be extending an olive branch as he hoped that they could one day get along and hang out with his and Kim’s kids. Ye’s only response to that was “NO YOU WILL NEVER MEET MY CHILDREN.” Once Pete deleted his just-recently-activated Instagram account, the rapper boasted that he changed his name to “Skete” and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ran him off Instagram</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>The most disturbing of all of Ye’s social media taunts was his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>music video</a> for the song “Eazy.” He had already made it clear he was coming for Pete in the track with the lyrics, “God saved me from the crash, just so I can beat Pete Davidson‘s ass.” But what was even more unsettling was the music video in which Ye drag’s Pete’s dead body and holds his decapitated head. All of Kanye’s Instagram antics caused Kim to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>unfollow him</a> as well as all of her sisters.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>All of this drama only motivated Kim to attain her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>legally single</a> status. Ye had blocked her first attempt but when she took it to the court, she was granted her request to be legally single. She also legally dropped West from her last name so she’s now just Kim Kardashian. She also celebrated by removing his last name from her social media accounts. Regardless of the drama, Kim doesn’t want an official <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>custody arrangement</a> and doesn’t plan on keeping Kanye out of their kids’ lives.</p><h2><strong>What Went Wrong Between Kim & Kanye’s Marriage</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kim-Kardashian-and-kanye-west-mega-embed-1.jpg>Following confirmation that Kim and Kanye were indeed in the midst of their divorce,&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife</strong> learned EXCLUSIVELY what <a href=#>the “final straw” was</a> for Kim. “Kim and Kanye both had met with lawyers. Kim felt she tried everything to make the marriage work and Kanye was refusing to get the help she requested which was the final straw,” our source shared, referencing Kanye’s <a href=#>mental health struggles</a>.<p id=content-paragraph-13>“She and <strong>Kris </strong>[<strong>Jenner</strong>] even tried to get him to go to counseling and offered support as best she could and he kept refusing.” It seems, however, that the former couple knew the end of their marriage was only a matter of time. “They both knew this was coming. Nobody was blindsided. For her, it’s always been about working through the financials more than the kids.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>On the final season of&nbsp;Keeping Up With the Kardashians, Kim also expanded on her reasoning for wanting to end things with Kanye. Aside from the fact that they had been fighting more, they were also <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>living very different lives</a> — Kanye was spending most of his time in Wyoming, while Kim was based in California. “He deserves someone who can go support his every move and follow him all over the place and move to Wyoming,” Kim said. “I can’t do that. He should have a wife who supports his every move and travels with him and everything and I can’t do that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>In another episode, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she added</a> that she just wasn’t happy anymore, and at 40 years old, she knew she deserved more. “I never thought I was lonely,” Kim admitted. “I always thought I was totally fine — I can just have my kids, and my husband moves from state to state and I’m on this ride with him. I [was] okay with that. But after turning 40 this year, I realized…no. I don’t want a husband that lives in a completely different state.” She also revealed that she and Kanye were actually getting along “best” when they were apart, and that felt “sad.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Kim explained that it was the “little things” that were missing in her marriage to Kanye — like having someone to work out with or watch a TV show with at night. “I have the extravagance, everything you could possibly imagine, and no one will ever do it like that,” she said. “I’m grateful for those experiences, but I think I’m ready for the smaller experiences that I think will mean a lot.”</p><h2><strong>Kim & Kanye’s Good Years&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kim-Kardashian-and-kanye-west-mega-embed.jpg>Despite the end of Kim and Kanye’s marriage, their life together was <a href=#>full of beautiful moments</a> and major contemporary pop culture touchstones. The couple started dating in 2012 and welcomed their first child, North, in June 2013. Less than one year later, the couple exchanged their vows in a beautiful wedding ceremony at Fort di Belvedere in Florence, Italy.<p id=content-paragraph-18>From there, the twosome welcomed three more children, including son Saint, and daughter Chicago and son Psalm. The couple’s two youngest children were born via surrogate. Throughout their marriage, the couple supported one another as Kim studied for the Bar exam and Kanye continued his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pursuits in the fashion industry</a>. Kim and the couple’s kiddos also attended Kanye’s Sunday Services regularly, and for Kim’s 40th birthday, Kanye created a special hologram message <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>from Kim’s late father</a>. There’s no doubt that these two supported each other unconditionally throughout their time together, and they created such a beautiful family together, as well.</p><h2><strong>Kim Kardashian’s Divorce From Kris Humphries</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kris-Humphries-kim-kardashian-shutter-embed-4.jpg>Prior to Kim’s marriage and subsequent divorce from Kanye, the SKIMS mogul endured another high-profile divorce. Kim was memorably married to basketball player&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Kris Humphries</strong></a> for <a href=#>only 72 days</a> before she filed for divorce. The couple’s marriage was a special event on&nbsp;KUWTK, which made the end of their romance all the more surprising for some. Years later, though, Kim revealed that she knew that <a href=#>the couple’s marriage</a> was not going to work.<p id=content-paragraph-20>“At the time I didn’t even — I just thought, ‘Holy sh*t, I’m 30 years old. I better get this together; I better get married.’ I think a lot of girls do go through that — where they freak out and think they’re getting old and they have to figure it out,” she revealed during an appearance on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Watch What Happens Live</a>. “But I knew, like, [by the] honeymoon it wasn’t going to work out.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>After the honeymoon, Kim and Kris moved to New York City to film a&nbsp;KUWTK spin-off,&nbsp;Kourtney & Kim Take New York. The unraveling of their relationship was documented on the show, as Kim realized that being married to the NBA star was not what she wanted anymore. The former couple’s divorce was messy, as Kris wanted an annulment, and Kim did not agree, as she did not feel there was any fraud committed in their relationship. After a lot of legal issues, the divorce was finally finalized in June 2013, just before Kim gave birth to North. Needless to say, Kim and Kris are not on speaking terms these days.</p><h2><strong>Kim Kardashian’s First Husband, Damon Thomas</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kris-Humphries-kim-kardashian-shutter-embed-5.jpg>Kim was only 19 years old when she eloped with music producer&nbsp;<strong>Damon Thomas</strong> and got married for the first time. The two went to Vegas and got hitched in 2000. At the time, Kim was actually “on ecstasy,” she revealed in a 2018 episode of KUWTK, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>People</a>.&nbsp;Kim also attributed the time in her life to her “wild phase,” but her marriage to Damon ended in divorce. Damon filed the paperwork in 2003 and the former couple’s marriage officially ended in 2004, after the divorce was finalized.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8qipGajkaexor%2FHopinZZSew7C%2Bwp5kbWtmZ4B6go4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkanye-west-her-other-marriages-that-ended-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkanye-west-her-other-marriages-that-ended-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkanye-west-her-other-marriages-that-ended-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkanye-west-her-other-marriages-that-ended-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkanye-west-her-other-marriages-that-ended-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkanye-west-her-other-marriages-that-ended-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./michael-fazio-obituary-chicago-steel-hockey-player-dies-at-31.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./michael-fazio-obituary-chicago-steel-hockey-player-dies-at-31.html>Michael Fazio Obituary: Chicago Steel Hockey player dies at 31</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./hottest-celebrity-pics-this-week-of-june-21-27-dean-unglert-caelynn-miller-keyes-more.html>Hottest Celebrity Pics This Week Of June 21-27: Dean Unglert &amp;amp; Caelynn Miller-Keyes &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./hottest-celebrity-pics-this-week-of-june-21-27-dean-unglert-caelynn-miller-keyes-more.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
