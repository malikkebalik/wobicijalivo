Emma Hunton's</span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true> fans started wondering whether the weight loss transformation was her character's brand new storyline.</span></strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><strong>Emma Hunton</strong> is an American <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>actress</a></strong>, born in Los Angeles, California, on August 26, 1991. Her mother is <strong>Erica Hunton</strong>.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The actress is well-recognized for her portrayal in several movies and television shows such as <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Good Trouble</a></strong>, Happy Endings, Angel, The Walton's, and Gunsmoke.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In October 2017, Hunton married her ex-husband,&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ryan Duval</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. Unfortunately, the couple split a few years ago. Ryan Duval is a chef who previously worked at The Wallace in Culver City. Hunton also discussed body shaming and positivity in a 2019 YouTube video produced by Freedom.</span></p><p>Previously, we touched on the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>weight loss</a></strong> stories of <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Winter Everett</a></strong> and <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Dan Fogler</a></strong>.</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Emma Hunton Before and After Weight Loss Journey!</span></h2><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Emma Hunton</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@emmahunton</a>) revealed her weight loss was due to happenings in her personal life. Fans of Emma Hunton began to speculate if the makeover was part of her character's new narrative.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>On the other hand, Hunton indicated that her weight loss was for events in her personal life.

The stunning actress has recently wowed her fans with a fantastic physique change.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Meanwhile, six months ago, Emma Hunton decided to reduce weight. She tried several ways before settling on one that worked for her. Hunton's journey began with assessing her BMI that revealed the higher end of the obese risk range. That epiphany launched her on a quest to understand more about her own body and how she might enhance it.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The 30-year-old <a href=# rel=noopener>TV star</a> tried many diets and activities before landing on one that would fit her lifestyle and weight loss objectives. She stated that the essential thing is to find something that you drive to accomplish because if you are not enjoying it, no one else will.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Emma Hunton discovered that making modifications, such as walking for 30 minutes instead of 3 hours every day or eating more fruits and vegetables, helped her maintain her enthusiasm.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Furthermore, the 5'2" actress constantly checked in with herself via social media and inquired whether she was looking for any benefits from her efforts. According to Hunton, having an accountability buddy is the best way to remain on track. However, it seems terrifying, but if you tell someone, it won't be.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>On the other hand, Emma Hunton's health blog is dedicated entirely to weight loss. Emma has adopted a vegetarian diet. The 25-year-old vegetarian shed pounds by adopting a plant-based diet. Hunton claims that her new eating habits resulted in more energy, better emotions, and a reduction in total body fat. The Good Trouble actress attributes her weight loss to her food adjustment and other health benefits.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Hunton's tale isn't unusual. A plant-based diet has helped with weight loss and other health issues.
