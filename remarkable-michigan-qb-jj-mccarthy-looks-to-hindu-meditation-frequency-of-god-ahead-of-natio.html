This remarkable feat also marked a significant milestone for the Wolverines, as they became the first college football program to reach 1,000 all-time wins. The team’s success on the field has captivated fans and sports enthusiasts alike, but it is McCarthy’s unconventional rituals off the field that have garnered attention and sparked curiosity.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Undefeated_Season_and_1000_All-Time_Wins></span>Undefeated Season and 1,000 All-Time Wins<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The Michigan Wolverines have etched their names in college football history with their undefeated season and the milestone of 1,000 all-time wins.

McCarthy’s unorthodox approach to preparation and mental focus has raised eyebrows and sparked discussions.

These exercises are believed to harness and manipulate universal energy, known as prana.

This ancient practice has been revered for centuries for its ability to cultivate inner peace and unlock hidden potential.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Listening_to_the_%E2%80%9CFrequency_of_God%E2%80%9D></span>Listening to the “Frequency of God”<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>As part of his pregame ritual, McCarthy immerses himself in the “frequency of God” by listening to a specific sound frequency, 963 hertz. This frequency, often referred to as the “frequency of God,” is believed to have profound effects on the mind and body. McCarthy finds solace in this unique form of white noise, which transcends ordinary auditory experiences and transports him to a state of heightened awareness. By attuning himself to this frequency, McCarthy seeks to tap into a higher power and channel divine inspiration during his performances on the football field.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Controversy_Surrounding_McCarthys_Practices></span>Controversy Surrounding McCarthy’s Practices<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While JJ McCarthy’s pregame rituals have garnered admiration from many, they have also sparked controversy and raised concerns among certain individuals.
