Although he has achieved popularity for his roles in cult gangster movies, his charming presence coupled with his onscreen elegance made him one of the most sought-after leading men in the film industry. García has become a well-established name in Hollywood but he is equally reputed for being very guarded in his personal life and usually prefers to stay out of the limelight. His long-standing career received a boost in 2018 with all 4 of his films receiving good reviews in that year.</p><h3>Born Name</h3><p>Andrés Arturo García Menéndez</p><h3>Nick Name</h3><p>Andy Arthur, Andres Garcia</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Andy-Garcia-at-the-2009-Deauville-American-Film-Festival.jpg><h3>Sun Sign</h3><p>Aries</p><h3>Born Place</h3><p>Havana, Cuba</p><h3>Residence</h3><p>Los Angeles, California, United States</p><h3>Nationality</h3><p>Cuban, American</p><h3>Education</h3><p>Andy studied at the <strong>Miami Beach Senior High School</strong>.

Following the Bay of Pigs Invasion in 1961, Andy’s father relocated his wife and 3 kids, including 5-year-old Andy, to Miami in Florida. After moving to the US, the García family launched a perfume company which has become a successful million-dollar business venture over time.</li><li>When he was born, he had remnants of an undeveloped conjoined twin attached to him by his shoulder. The twin was the size of a grapefruit and had to be surgically removed. All that’s left is a scar from that operation.</li><li>He is good friends with fellow actor Mickey Rourke. Rourke was his baseball coach while studying at Miami Beach Senior High School.</li><li>García was included in Empire Magazine‘s 1995 issue as one of the ‘100 Sexiest Stars in film history’ at the 65th spot.</li><li>He has never done n#de scenes in films. He refused to oblige when asked to appear shirtless for an audition and famously walked out.</li><li>Winning the role of Vincent Mancini in <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Francis Ford Coppola</a>‘s third installment in The Godfather series put him on the map as an actor. The role was one of the most coveted parts of the decade with many established actors like <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Val Kilmer</a>, <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Robert De Niro</a>, <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Alec Baldwin</a>, <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Charlie Sheen</a>, and Vincent Spano campaigning for the part.</li><li>Andy’s niece Jackie García was engaged to footballer Sean Taylor. Sean, a Washington Redskins safety, was shot by intruders in his house on November 26, 2007. Although Jackie and their 18-month-old daughter were unharmed in the incident, her fiancé Taylor succumbed to his injuries and died the next day.</li><li>In recent years, he has expressed his interest to return to his home country of Cuba. But, he has clarified that he is opposed to the current authoritarian regime of the Castro family.</li><li>García directed the 2005 film The Lost City, written by Cuban writer Guillermo Cabrera Infante. The film took 16 years to make and is a love song to his Cuban culture and its heritage.</li><li>Follow Andy García on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Facebook</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Twitter</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Instagram</a>.</li><p>Featured Image by Mireille Ampilhac / <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Wikimedia</a> / CC BY-SA 2.0</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jpqlnbFdnK6zr8iaZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fandy-garc%25C3%25ADa-height-weight-age-spouse-family-facts-biography.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fandy-garc%25C3%25ADa-height-weight-age-spouse-family-facts-biography.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fandy-garc%25C3%25ADa-height-weight-age-spouse-family-facts-biography.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fandy-garc%25C3%25ADa-height-weight-age-spouse-family-facts-biography.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fandy-garc%25C3%25ADa-height-weight-age-spouse-family-facts-biography.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fandy-garc%25C3%25ADa-height-weight-age-spouse-family-facts-biography.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./carey-lowell.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./carey-lowell.html>Carey Lowell</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-is-beyonc%C3%A9-real-name-and-age-boyfriend-wiki-parents.html>What Is Beyonc Real Name and Age?
