She had, on the contrary, essayed a very homely girl in her first film and the complete opposite role in the film had been challenging to her, particularly because of the negative shades in it.</li><li>After completing her debut films, she had considered quitting movies as her studies were getting hampered. Also, she was not satisfied with the offers she was getting. However, producer, writer, and director M. S. Raju approached her family and they all discussed the matter professionally, ending up reigniting her passion for acting.</li><li>She has disclosed that in real life, she has been shy and tomboyish by nature.</li><li>She has recalled that when the director of the film Dirty Hari, M. S. Raju, had informed that she would have to do sensual scenes, she had got apprehensive. He had suggested she forgot herself and get into the skin of the character of liberal Jasmine. There used to be 70 to 80 people on set who would get curious during the making of those scenes, which would, in turn, make her feel uncomfortable. That had made her request Raju to ensure having only the people required to be present there, who had also played songs to help her relax and get into the mood of the scene.</li><li>Simratt has been grateful to her mother for having guided her regarding controversial scenes, having told her to never think about what others may say, but instead, to take her profession as a religion and always put in her best efforts.</li><li>Simratt has confessed that after her movie Parichayam, she had thought of not doing acting anymore. She was doing graduation when she had left it mid-way to do the feature and when it did not do very well, she got stooped in a dilemma. She has always tended to be emotional. Her family had backed her up and advised her to not give up. It was at that time that MS Raju had appeared and offered her the part in Dirty Hari.</li><li>Simratt has revealed that as an actor, she has been open to essaying any character, provided it has depth and is relatable. She has also looked for strong scripts with good content. She has been happy that a lot of stress is being given for films to have a good storyline. Simratt has added that she would love to do a sports-based drama as she has been a gold medalist in Karate, having taken part in numerous Karate championships at the national level.</li><li>In 2023, she played the role of Muskaan in the blockbuster hit movie Gadar 2 starring <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Sunny Deol</a> and <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Ameesha Patel</a>.</li><p>Featured Image by Simratt Kaur / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqygpqqRqXqsrdSrZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsimratt-kaur-height-weight-age-boyfriend-family-biography.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsimratt-kaur-height-weight-age-boyfriend-family-biography.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsimratt-kaur-height-weight-age-boyfriend-family-biography.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsimratt-kaur-height-weight-age-boyfriend-family-biography.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsimratt-kaur-height-weight-age-boyfriend-family-biography.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsimratt-kaur-height-weight-age-boyfriend-family-biography.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./catelynn-baltierra-married-husband-children-miscarriage-wiki-bio.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./catelynn-baltierra-married-husband-children-miscarriage-wiki-bio.html>Catelynn Baltierra Married, Husband, Children, Miscarriage, Wiki-Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./know-the-relationship-status-and-net-worth-of.html>Know The Relationship Status and Net Worth of</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./know-the-relationship-status-and-net-worth-of.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
