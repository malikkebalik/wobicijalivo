He went to Day Care School in Nasik for his early education and then NBT Law College for his college education. During high school and college, he was involved in cultural activities and led the way in planning a number of festivals and cultural programs. This gave him a knack for acting, which became his passion later on.</p><p>So, once he was done with school, he went to Mumbai to follow his dreams. After some trouble, he was able to get a part in a TV show called Tu Ashi Javli Raha, which is about to start on the Zee Yuva channel. But he got lucky and got the M Town movie first instead of the TV show. His first venture into entertainment in a local language was a movie called “Bhay,” which came out in the summer of 2018.</p><figure id=attachment_21435 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-21435 class="wp-caption aligncenter">Siddharth Bodke</figure><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;Nash and Chord Overstreet Are Famous Brother Each Doing His Own Thing</strong></p><p>Even though he is the most eligible bachelor in town, he is still very single and not ready to start dating.

He has been advertising his TV show on top of all the other ways he does it. Stay with us to find out more about it and other things.</p><p>Siddharth Bodke has been getting a lot of praise for his role as David in “Drishyam 2,” which also stars Ajay Devgn and Tabu. But David wasn’t the part he was chosen for at first.</p><p>Abhishek Pathak, the director of the movie, insisted that he try out for the part of David. As fate would have it, he did a great job at the audition and got the part.</p><p>About the same thing, he told IANS: “I got a call from the casting agency for Vicky Sidana and tried out for another part in the movie. I was even chosen for that. Later, the director, Abhishek Pathak, asked me to try out for the part of David. That’s how I got the part. I have to say that I loved playing it because it was hard.”</p><p>The actor, who is currently on the popular TV show “Ghum Hai Kisikey Pyaar Mein,” talked about how he prepared for his role in the movie.</p><p>He talked about his role in the movie and said: “It’s a Goan who is a Catholic. I talked to some people from Goa to learn their language. Later, I asked the director to make the character’s voice a little different, so I gave it a bit of a husky sound. This was necessary because my character used to sell drugs. I have also tried to get to know David better. When I first met the director, he told me to put on some weight, so I did. I gained about 4-5 kg for the role, and my thick beard helped me look the part.”</p><p>He said this about what the director told him: “Before the shoot, Abhishek told me everything, and we met in his office before going to Goa. He went over the whole graph, and when we were on set, we would talk about it first to keep the mood and intensity high.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/smartindianews.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Siddharth-Bodke-1-300x231.png><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;Is Jojo Siwa, Famous American Dancer Pregnant?

For those who don’t know, Virat doesn’t know Savi is his daughter. He sees Jagtap with Sai and thinks Savi is the daughter of Jagtap and Sai.</p><p>The part of Jagtap is played by Siddharth Bodke. He used to play a bad role, but now he plays a good one. Now, he’s Sai’s friend and helps her. Fans have also started to love how well Jagtap and Sai get along. Well, Ayesha and Siddharth are also good friends away from the camera.</p><p>In an interview with India Forums, Siddharth talked about how they felt about each other “We both began the show at the same time with Ayesha.

It makes us feel comfortable and close to each other.”</p><p><strong>Read More:&nbsp;Aishwarya Sharma Age, Height, Relationship, Family, Net Worth and Bio</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGiqopyUna6zwMdmmaicm5p6orPEZp%2BeoZedwW6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mnZqlmaHGbrrErWSwp6KptW6tzZ1km6GfZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsiddharth-bodke-age-height-relationship-family-net-worth-and-bio-the-talks-today.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsiddharth-bodke-age-height-relationship-family-net-worth-and-bio-the-talks-today.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsiddharth-bodke-age-height-relationship-family-net-worth-and-bio-the-talks-today.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsiddharth-bodke-age-height-relationship-family-net-worth-and-bio-the-talks-today.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsiddharth-bodke-age-height-relationship-family-net-worth-and-bio-the-talks-today.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsiddharth-bodke-age-height-relationship-family-net-worth-and-bio-the-talks-today.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./240-flower-names-for-girls-with-meanings.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./240-flower-names-for-girls-with-meanings.html>240+ Flower Names for Girls (with Meanings)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./shocking-odessa-tx-motorcycle-accident-2-dead-victim-identified-as-christopher-sterling-rider-of.html>Shocking!
