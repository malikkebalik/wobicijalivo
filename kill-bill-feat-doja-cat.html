The lyrics convey her bitterness and jealousy towards his new girlfriend, and her longing to be with him again. She even goes as far as to consider killing both her ex and his new girlfriend, rather than let him be with anyone else.</p><br><p>The opening lines ("I'm still a fan even though I was salty / Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy / Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin' / I'm so mature, I'm so mature") set the tone for the song. SZA admits that she's salty, i.e. resentful, about her ex dating someone else, but she still cares for him and wants him to be happy. However, she is also aware of her immaturity and her inability to let go of her attachment to him.</p><br><p>As the song progresses, SZA becomes increasingly fixated on her ex, to the point where she considers killing him and his new girlfriend. The lyrics "I might kill my ex / Not the best idea / His new girlfriend's next / How'd I get here?" reveal her dangerous thoughts and her confusion about how she ended up in such a dark place. She acknowledges that killing someone is not a "rational" or "mature" solution, but her emotions override her rationality.</p><br><p>The chorus ("I'm so mature, I'm so mature / I'm so mature I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men / I don't want none, I just want you / If I can't have you, no one should / I might") further emphasizes SZA's immaturity and her inability to let go of her ex. She claims to be mature, but her actions indicate otherwise. She even admits to seeing a therapist, but despite their advice to move on, she still wants her ex.</p><br><p>Overall, "Kill Bill" is a cautionary tale about the dangers of obsession and the consequences of not letting go of a failed relationship. It's a reminder that while love can be a powerful emotion, it's not worth risking your life or someone else's for.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>I'm still a fan even though I was salty</u><br>Despite feeling angry before, I still admire you.</p><br><p><u>Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy</u><br>It hurts me to see you happy with another woman.</p><br><p><u>Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'</u><br>It's painful to see you happy if I'm not the one who made it happen.</p><br><p><u>I'm so mature, I'm so mature</u><br>I'm trying to convince myself that I'm an adult.</p><br><p><u>I'm so mature I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men</u><br>I'm so mature that I see a therapist to help me accept that there are other men in the world.</p><br><p><u>I don't want none, I just want you</u><br>I don't want anyone else, I want only you.</p><br><p><u>If I can't have you, no one should</u><br>If I can't be with you, I don't want anyone else to have you either.</p><br><p><u>I might</u><br>I am considering a violent option.</p><br><p><u>I might kill my ex</u><br>I am thinking about murdering my former partner.</p><br><p><u>Not the best idea</u><br>This plan is not a good one.</p><br><p><u>His new girlfriend's next</u><br>His new girlfriend is also a target.</p><br><p><u>How'd I get here?</u><br>I don't know how I ended up in this situation.</p><br><p><u>I still love him though</u><br>Despite everything, I still have feelings for him.</p><br><p><u>Rather be in jail than alone</u><br>I would rather be in prison than be without him.</p><br><p><u>I get the sense that it's a lost cause</u><br>I believe that it's hopeless to try and win you back.</p><br><p><u>I get the sense that you might really love her</u><br>I think that you are in love with the other woman.</p><br><p><u>The text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence</u><br>I'm aware that discussing these ideas through text will implicate me.</p><br><p><u>I tried to ration with you, no murders or crime of passion</u><br>I tried to talk to you and convince you that these violent thoughts were not appropriate.</p><br><p><u>But damn, you was out of reach</u><br>But you were so far away from me, it felt like I couldn't reach you.</p><br><p><u>You was at the farmers market with your perfect peach</u><br>You were with your new partner at the farmers market, someone who you believe to be perfect.</p><br><p><u>Now I'm in the basement plannin' home invasion</u><br>Now I'm making plans to break into your home and commit violence.</p><br><p><u>Now you layin' facedown, got me sayin', "R-I-P"</u><br>Now that you are dead, I am grieving and saying rest in peace.</p><br><p><u>I did it all for love (love)</u><br>I committed these violent acts out of love, despite how twisted that may seem.</p><br><p><u>I did it all on no drugs (drugs)</u><br>I committed these acts while sober, without the use of any substances.</p><br><p><u>Don't you know I did it all for us?
