The&nbsp;<strong>Blink-182</strong> drummer officially got married to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a>&nbsp;on May 15 in Santa Barbra. Travis, 46, and Kourtney, 43, were friends for years before their relationship turned romantic in 2020. <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Kardashians</a>&nbsp;star was previously in a relationship with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Scott Disick</strong></a>, the father of her <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>three children</a>, but they never got married. Travis, on the other hand, walked down the aisle twice before he fell in love with Kourtney. Here’s everything you need to know about Travis’ ex-wives, plus his marriage to Kourtney.</p><h2>Melissa Kennedy</h2><p id=content-paragraph-3>Travis’ first marriage was to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Melissa Kennedy</strong></a>, 39. They tied the knot in September 2001, which was at the height of Blink-182’s fame, but split up in August 2002. Melissa was featured in both of the band’s documentaries, 1999’s&nbsp;The Urethra Chronicles&nbsp;and 2002’s The Urethra Chronicles II. She also served as the vice president to Travis’ punk and hip-hop-inspired fashion brand <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Famous Stars and Straps</a>&nbsp;from 1999 until May 2002, shortly before their split. Travis had Melissa’s name tattooed across&nbsp;his neck in script, but he eventually covered it with a gorgeous rose tattoo.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Melissa has kept a low profile since her divorce from Travis. According to her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>LinkedIn page</a>, she joined the real estate field as a salesperson for Pacific Sands Mortgage and Realty Inc. from June 2003 to March 2006. Melissa has been working as a broker for Lifestyle Estates Realty And Funding Inc. in Orange County, Calif. since March 2006.</p><h2>Shanna Moakler</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Travis-Barkers-Wives-shutter-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Travis got married to actress and Miss USA 1995 titleholder&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Shanna Moakler</strong></a>, 47, on October 30, 2004. They had been dating for two years before their&nbsp;gothic, The Nightmare Before Christmas-inspired wedding. Travis actually proposed to Shanna in the elevator portion of the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland. After two years of marriage, Travis filed for divorce — and it was messy. The exes dragged each other on MySpace (it was that long ago) and aired their dirty laundry. They rekindled their relationship twice — even after finalizing their divorce in 2008. Ultimately, they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ended their romance</a> for good in 2009.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Travis and Shanna had two children together: son <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Landon</strong></a>, 19, and daughter <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Alabama</strong></a>, 17. Travis also became a stepfather to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Atiana De La Hoya</strong></a>, 25, who is Shanna’s daughter from her previous marriage to famous boxer <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Oscar De La Hoya</strong></a>. The whole family was featured on the MTV reality show&nbsp;Meet the Barkers&nbsp;which aired from 2005 to 2006.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Things were amicable for a while between Travis and Shanna. However, the actress has been critical of her ex-husband’s romance with Kourtney. Shanna’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>liked shady comments</a>&nbsp;on Instagram about “Kravis.” She also <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>told&nbsp;People</a> in May 2021, “I’m very much over my ex. It’s been a long time. However, do I think&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>some of the PDA</a> that he’s doing with her is weird? [Yes].” In Nov. 2021, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a source</a> told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> EXCLUSIVELY that Shanna “is devastated that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her kids</a> are spending so much time with the Kardashians.” Our insider also said that the exes’ children “still go” to Travis versus Shanna and “feel far more connected” to the rockstar.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Since May 2020, Shanna has been in an on-again, off-again relationship with model <strong>Matthew Rondeau</strong>. Following her appearance on season 3 of&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Celebrity Big Brother</a>&nbsp;in early 2022, Matthew <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>broke up with Shanna</a> and hurled expletives about her in a since-deleted Instagram post, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six</a>. He was arrested in L.A. and charged with domestic violence after a fight between the pair allegedly broke out. Shanna then announced that she <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>was pregnant</a>, but then clarified that the test was <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>actually a false positive</a>. It’s unclear if Shanna and Matthew are still together.</p><h2>Kourtney Kardashian</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Travis-Barkers-Wives-shutter-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Travis and Kourtney were simply <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>friends and neighbors</a>&nbsp;before they became a romantic item. The rumors about their romance started in early 2021, and then they became <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram official</a> as a couple just after Valentine’s Day. After months of a PDA-filled romance, Travis and Kourtney <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>got engaged</a> in October 2021. Travis proposed in the middle of a&nbsp;gorgeous floral arrangement on the beach in Montecito, California. Six months later, the couple had <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>an unofficial wedding</a> in Las Vegas on April 3, 2022, after Travis performed at the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Grammy Awards</a>. Travis and Kourtney <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>finally got married</a>, for real, at the courthouse in Santa Barbara on May 15.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>The “Kravis” wedding celebrations aren’t over yet. Travis and Kourtney are saying “I do” again at their <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>upcoming dream wedding in Italy</a>. Travis’ children and Kourtney’s kids&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Mason</strong></a>, 13, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Penelope</strong>,</a> 10, and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Reign</strong></a>, 8, will be there. Her mom <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a> and her sisters <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kim Kardashian,</strong></a> <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Khloe Kardashian</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kendall Jenner</strong></a> are expected to attend, as well. The wedding is supposedly being filmed for&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Kardashians&nbsp;on Hulu</a>, which Travis has appeared on. Travis and Kourtney have openly showed their <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>fertility journey</a> to have a baby together on the show.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>A year after ending their IVF journey, Kourtney <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>announced she was pregnant</a> with their first child together on June 16, 2023. She held up a sign reading “Travis I’m Pregnant” during his Los Angeles concert the same night, a sweet callback to his 1999 music video for “All The Small Things” with Blink 182. Travis appeared overjoyed and emotional at the news as he went down from the stage to kiss Kourtney! Congratulations to the couple.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9OrmK%2Bho2Kvor7Knqlmr5mbsm6Alm1pcmhoZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feverything-to-know-about-his-3-marriages-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2feverything-to-know-about-his-3-marriages-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2feverything-to-know-about-his-3-marriages-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2feverything-to-know-about-his-3-marriages-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feverything-to-know-about-his-3-marriages-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2feverything-to-know-about-his-3-marriages-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./fame-john-henry-mills-net-worth-and-salary-income-estimation-jan-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./fame-john-henry-mills-net-worth-and-salary-income-estimation-jan-2024.html>Fame | John Henry Mills net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./duk-da-danuwansa-yana-takarar-gwamna-garo-ya-ce-ba-zai-zabi-jam-iyyar-apc-ba.html>Duk da Danuwansa Yana Takarar Gwamna, Garo Ya Ce Ba Zai Zabi Jamiyyar APC ba</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./duk-da-danuwansa-yana-takarar-gwamna-garo-ya-ce-ba-zai-zabi-jam-iyyar-apc-ba.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
