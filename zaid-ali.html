His fans have praised his portrayals of female characters.</p><p>He frequently portrays female characters by draping a “dupatta” (scarf) over his head, which has become his signature look.

This proved to be a wise decision, as the number of views on his YouTube channel increased.</p><p>As a result, Zaid has removed all of his profanity-laced videos from his YouTube channel. His first video was titled ‘Your Profile Picture is Cute.’<br>He eventually started making more relatable videos, especially about the lives of “brown” people.

Zaid also has a YouTube channel called ‘ZaidAliT Vlogs,’ where he primarily posts life vlogs. Furthermore, his wife appears in the channel’s most popular vlog. Zaid did a Q&A video with his wife after they married to tell his fans more about them. This vlog channel has a higher number of subscribers than the main channel.</p><p>Zaid has millions of followers on both Twitter and Instagram. He took part in the ‘United We Stand’ UK tour in 2015. He was also offered a part in a Hollywood film, which he turned down because the script called for a kissing scene. Zaid is opposed to getting intimate on camera.
