<time>09 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Of the things Duane Chapman is known for, being a good father is not one of them. The former bondsman was constantly in and out of prison and rarely had time for his kids. Even after his release, Duane did not establish the best relationships with his children and carried on with his life. While all of his children have been a victim of his behaviors, nobody has it worse than Lyssa. Pregnant at a young age, left by her mother, drugs, and so much more ruined Lisa’s life. In this article, we take a closer look at the wiki-bio of Lyssa Chapman.</p><p><strong>List of Contents</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=1>A Harrowing Childhood</h2><p>Lyssa Chapman was born on June 10, 1987, in Denver, Colorado, as the ninth of twelve children of Duane “Dog” Chapman, a famous bounty hunter, and his third wife, Lyssa Rae Brittain. She was nicknamed “Baby Lyssa” to distinguish her from her mother, who was also called Lyssa.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/website-2020-08-09T220417.041.jpg><p>She spent her childhood with her father until she was eleven years old, when she moved to a small Alaskan town, Anderson, with her mother. She falsely accused her father of raping her, but it was a friend of her father who had molested her. Talking about the incident, Lyssa <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a>,</p><p>“I [falsely] accused my father of raping me when I was 11. I had been molested by a friend of his. It was a horrible life that I never wanted to go back to, living with him and Beth and the fighting and the drugs. When I got to my mother’s, although she drank, it was much more peaceful. I was in school, I had friends, I was willing to do anything to not go back.”</p><p>Lyssa lost contact with her father for six years, during which she faced many challenges and hardships. She became pregnant at 14 with her first daughter, Abbie Mae Chapman, whose father was 24 years old and later arrested for statutory rape. Lyssa had to grow up fast and take care of her child, while also dealing with the stigma and shame of being a teenage mother.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=2>Alcoholism & Coming Clean</h2><p>Lyssa’s struggle with alcohol began at a young age when she was exposed to her parents’ turbulent relationship and divorce. Her mother, Lyssa Rae Brittain, was accused by her daughter of drinking heavily after the split, while her father was often absent. Lyssa felt neglected and unloved by both of them and turned to alcohol as a way of coping with her pain and loneliness.</p><p>She reconnected with her father when she was 17 and started working with him at his bail bonds company, Da Kine Bail Bonds. However, Lyssa’s life was far from easy. She faced many challenges and dangers as a bounty hunter, chasing down fugitives and criminals with her father and his crew. She also had a tumultuous marriage with Brahman “Bo” Galanti whom she married in 2009. Lyssa’s alcohol addiction worsened over the years, as she tried to numb her trauma and stress. She was arrested in 2011 for criminal property damage and assaulting a police officer after she got into a drunken altercation with her neighbors.&nbsp;</p><p>Lyssa realized that she needed to change her life before it was too late. She decided to quit drinking and seek professional help for her addiction and mental health. She also wrote an autobiography, Walking on Eggshells: Discovering Strength and Courage Amid Chaos, in which she shared her story of overcoming adversity and finding hope.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=3>Working with her Father & Television</h2><p>After moving in with her father, Lyssa helped <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Duane Chapman</a> and Beth carry on the Bond Business. Lyssa Chapman joined her father and his team of bounty hunters on the television series Dog the Bounty Hunter in 2005. She was nicknamed Baby Lyssa by her father and became a licensed bounty hunter at age 19. The show followed their adventures as they tracked down and captured fugitives across the United States and abroad. She appeared in 82 episodes of the show until 2012, when it was canceled by A&E.</p><p>In 2008, she participated in Celebrity Family Feud with her father and other family members. They competed against the family of Christopher Knight, best known for playing Peter Brady on The Brady Bunch. The Chapmans won the game and donated their prize money to a charity.</p><p>In 2010, she was featured in an episode of E! True Hollywood Story that chronicled her father’s life and career. She also appeared in a comedy TV movie called The Bill Zucker TP Tales.</p><p>In 2013, she made a cameo appearance on Hawaii Five-0, playing herself in an episode titled “Imi Loko Ka ‘Uhane” (Seek Within One’s Soul). She also appeared on Inside Edition to talk about her father’s health issues.</p><p>In 2014, she returned to bounty hunting with her father and stepmother Beth Chapman on Dog and Beth: On the Hunt. She appeared in two episodes of the show, which aired on CMT, which was also her last television show appearance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=4>Current Endeavors & Net Worth</h2><p>Lyssa has also pursued various business ventures since leaving the television world. She and Evensen previously owned a tanning salon in Hawaii. In November 2019, Lyssa launched an online clothing line that sells gym wear and accessories. She also joined OnlyFans, an adult-oriented subscription-only social media platform, where she shares exclusive content with her fans. Lyssa has an estimated net worth of $1.5 Million as of 2023.</p><p>In addition to her entrepreneurial endeavors, Lyssa has also dedicated herself to helping others. She teamed up with fellow reality star Rainy Robinson to create a website called Lost Never Forgotten, which aims to find missing children and sex trafficking victims. The website allows family members and loved ones of missing people to reach out to them and request help. Lyssa said that this is her way of finding redemption and doing good in the world.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=5>Controversies</h2><p>Lyssa has faced some troubles of her own, both in her personal and professional life. Lyssa has been arrested twice in Hawaii.&nbsp;The first time was in 2011 when she was charged with criminal property damage and assaulting a police officer. She allegedly got into a fight with her neighbors and started banging on their doors and windows. When the police arrived, she reportedly resisted arrest and kicked an officer in the chest. She later pleaded no contest to the charges and was sentenced to probation.</p><p>The second time was in 2020, when she was charged with harassment and resisting arrest. She allegedly struck and shoved a man and a woman, who turned out to be her girlfriend, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>. She also allegedly refused to cooperate with the police and tried to walk away from them. She was released on bail and is awaiting trial.</p><p>Lyssa has also been involved in some controversies with her family, especially after the death of her stepmother, Beth Chapman, who succumbed to cancer in 2019. Lyssa has publicly feuded with her father’s friend, Moon Angell, who was Beth’s former assistant and who appeared to have a romantic relationship with Dog after Beth’s passing.&nbsp;Lyssa <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">accused</a> Moon of being a “con artist” and a “scum” who moved in on her father weeks after losing his wife. She also expressed her disapproval of Dog’s apparent proposal to Moon on The Dr. Oz Show, which turned out to be a publicity stunt.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=6>Personal Life</h2><p>Lyssa’s journey to finding her true self was not easy. She had to overcome many challenges and hardships, including an abusive marriage, a divorce, and the loss of her beloved stepmother Beth Chapman. She also had to face the scrutiny and judgment of the public eye, as she starred in her father’s show Dog the Bounty Hunter. But Lyssa did not let these obstacles stop her from living her life authentically and happily. She found solace and support in her partner Leiana, a physical fitness trainer and scuba diver, who shares her passion for adventure and nature.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Marriage & Children</h2><p>Lyssa Chapman married her longtime partner, Leiana Evensen, a fitness trainer, in a beautiful ceremony in Hawaii. The couple met in 2016, when Leiana was a customer at Lyssa’s storefront.&nbsp;They discovered that they shared the same birthday, as well as similar morals and goals.&nbsp;They got engaged in December 2017, during a romantic trip to Seattle. The couple exchanged vows on June 3, 2022, in the presence of seven of their closest family members, with their feet in the water and the majestic Ko’olau mountain range as their backdrop. Lyssa took on her wife’s surname and expressed her happiness and gratitude on Instagram, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">saying</a> that she never thought she was worthy or capable of this kind of love.&nbsp;Leiana also shared her love for Lyssa on social media, saying that she falls deeper and deeper in love with her every single day.</p><p>Lyssa has two children from previous relationships.&nbsp;She had her first child, daughter Abbie Mae Chapman, at the age of 15 with a 24-year-old man who was later arrested for statutory rape. She also married Brahman Galanti on February 20, 2009, with whom she shares a daughter Madalynn Grace Galanti.&nbsp;Lyssa filed for divorce in 2011.&nbsp;The reason behind their divorce was&nbsp;domestic violence.&nbsp;Galanti reportedly abused Chapman on multiple occasions.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=7>Faith in God</h2><p>Lisa has had quite the journey. While she has come through at every moment in her life, Lisa credits her faith in God who helped her through her hurdles.&nbsp;</p><p>“When people ask me, ‘How are you still standing?’ I just say ‘God.’ He’s the one role model who’s been there my whole life. He’s the one person who loves me unconditionally and I feel that if it was not for my relationship with God I would not be standing.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=8>Physical Traits</h2><p>Lyssa Chapman has blonde hair, hazel green eyes, and a stature of 5 feet 1 inc or (155 cm). She also has several tattoos on her arms and chest that showcase her personality and style.</p><p>Lyssa loves to flaunt her toned body and ample cleavage in various outfits, ranging from colorful bikinis to cozy joggers.

She also likes to accessorize with hats, sunglasses, and jewelry to complete her look.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CqO_x7gr7_P/</p></figure><p>Lyssa is not afraid to experiment with different colors and patterns, as she likes to express herself through her fashion choices.
