The other constant is his wife, Tammy Reid, and without her, he might not have won what he has today.</p><p>But other than her supportive nature, there's not much known about their private life. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Andy Reid's Married Life with Wife Tammy Reid</h2><p>Andy and his wife&nbsp;met when they were very young. They <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">first came across</a> each other while attending Brigham Young University in the early '80s. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They began dating, and she soon had a profound effect on his life.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>He grew up a "not-very-observant" Lutheran. Tammy, on the other hand, came from a devout Mormon family. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>NFL Super Bowl-winning coach Andy Reid poses for a picture with his wife, Tammy Reid.&nbsp;</strong>(Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Soon after they met, he converted to being a Mormon and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">became a member</a> of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After university, where he played football for the college team, they married. Their wedding was on August 8, 1981.</p><p>Andy's birth name is Andrew, and only Tammy is allowed to call him that.</p><p>The <a href=# rel=follow>NFL coach</a> and his wife had five children —&nbsp;Garrett, Spencer, Britt, Crosby, and Drew Ann. As Andy started getting into his coaching career, Tammy took care of the household and their family. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Among their kids, Brit and Garrett are the most well-known in the media, mainly because of their drug issues in the past. Both Brit and Garrett battled with drug addiction and spent time behind bars.</p><p>While Britt made it out of the precarious situation, Garrett, unfortunately, could not. He succumbed to a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">heroin overdose</a>&nbsp;on August 5, 2012, in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. He was only 29 at the time.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Britt, after his recovery in 2009, started getting more into football. First, he worked as a camp coordinator for the Eagles.</p><p>Then, he spent three seasons working on offense at Temple University and finally joined the Chiefs, where his father was. He was eventually let go in 2020 after his contract expired.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Andy Reid's Wife Is His Pillar</h2><p>Tammy has always been by Andy's side when he was completely engulfed by football. On some days, he would leave for the office at 4 am and would not return until 11 at night, leaving her to do all the housework.</p><p>Andy has always acknowledged her presence and support. He even said winning the 2020 Super Bowl would not have been possible if it was not for her.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>During a post-match interview after the 2020 Super Bowl, he mentioned his "<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">four legs</a>." They were the most important things that led him to achieve his dream. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The first three were football, the church, and his family. However, the last one was arguably the most important — his wife and her companionship.</p><p>The day after the win, Andy, in a jolly mood, revealed that he did not even spend that much time with the trophy. Instead, he <a href=# rel="follow noopener">quipped</a>, "I didn't spend the night with the trophy. I spent it with my trophy wife."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJmemcZuvsSim2avmZuyb7TTpqM%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-andy-reid-s-wife-and-his-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmeet-andy-reid-s-wife-and-his-family.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmeet-andy-reid-s-wife-and-his-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmeet-andy-reid-s-wife-and-his-family.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-andy-reid-s-wife-and-his-family.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-andy-reid-s-wife-and-his-family.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./net-worth-family-and-rising-stardom.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./net-worth-family-and-rising-stardom.html>Net Worth, Family, and Rising Stardom</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jodi-eichelberger-net-worth.html>Jodi Eichelberger Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jodi-eichelberger-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
