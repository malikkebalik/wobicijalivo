Cameron Mica Boyce was a well-known American actor. He got his start as an actor when he was a child. Jessie, a comedy on the Disney Channel, was the first show in which he was the main character.</p><p>Cameron was going to be the next big thing on the Disney Channel, but no one knows how he died. For Disney, it was a big loss. People are curious about how he died. This article will help you find out what happened to him. Let’s find out.</p><h2>Who Was Cameron Boyce?</h2><p style=color:#252525><a href=# rel=noopener>Cameron Boyce</a> was born in Los Angeles, Calif., on May 28, 1999. The American actor was creative and good at dancing from a young age. He also learned how to break dance, hip hop, modern dance, jazz dance, tap dance, and ballet. He liked to break dance, and he and his other four friends had formed a group called “x Mob.”</p><p style=color:#252525>Cameron’s first role as a child actor was in the music video “That Green Gentleman (Things Have Changed)” in May 2008. Later in 2008, Boyce made his debut in a full-length film called “Mirrors,” which also starred Kiefer Sutherland.</p><p style=color:#252525>Cameron was also known for being in a lot of Disney shows, like Jessie, Shake It Up, Good Luck Charlie, and many more. In the 2015 Disney movie Descendants, he played Carlos, the son of the well-known Disney villain Cruella de Vil.</p><p style=color:#252525>This was his most well-known role for Disney. He reprised his role in the animated shorts Descendants: The Wicked World, Descendants 2 and 3. The third part came out after his death.</p><h2><strong>How Did “Disney Channel Star” Cameron Boyce Pass Away?</strong></h2><p>Cameron was found not moving at his home in Los Angeles, California, on July 6, 2019. The police were called, and when they got to Cameron’s house and checked him out, they pronounced him dead on the spot.</p><p>On July 30, 2019, the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner released his autopsy report, which confirmed that Boyce’s death was caused by sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (Sudep). Cameron’s body was burned, and his ashes were given to his family.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Victor Boyce (@thevictorboyce)</a></p><h2><strong>Cameron Boyce </strong>Parents Spokes About His Death</h2><p>He was only 20 years old. After his sudden death, a family member’s spokesperson said that Boyce had died in his sleep because of a seizure caused by an “ongoing medical condition.” His family also said that the actor had suffered from epilepsy in the past and was getting treatment for it.</p><p></p><h2>What Is Epilepsy And Sudep?</h2><p style=color:#252525>Epilepsy is a disease in which the brain’s nerve cells don’t work as they should, which makes seizures happen. These seizures can be mild or very bad. People with epilepsy are always treated as if they are going to die, but they live full, productive lives.</p><p style=color:#252525>People who had very violent seizures as children, on the other hand, are always at risk of developing Sudep. Sudep stands for Sudden Death Without Warning in Epilepsy. In this case, the person often has a seizure and dies in their sleep at night. This is what led to the death of Boyce.</p><p><strong>Read More</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Jane Fonda Admits That Her Facelift Has Made Her “Not Proud”</a></li><li><a href=#>Maddie Ziegler And Eddie Benjamin’s Relationship Timeline: An Update On Relationship Status!</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX528uHnDoptmm5GisrO7zWaZqLGTmnqltcSdZm1sYGmEcA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-did-disney-channel-star-cameron-boyce-pass-away.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-did-disney-channel-star-cameron-boyce-pass-away.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-did-disney-channel-star-cameron-boyce-pass-away.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-did-disney-channel-star-cameron-boyce-pass-away.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-did-disney-channel-star-cameron-boyce-pass-away.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-did-disney-channel-star-cameron-boyce-pass-away.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kylee-russell-bachelor-ethnicity-in-paradise-instagram-race-eliminated.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kylee-russell-bachelor-ethnicity-in-paradise-instagram-race-eliminated.html>Kylee Russell Bachelor Ethnicity, In Paradise, Instagram, Race, Eliminated</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./everything-to-know-about-the-women-he-loved-hollywood-life.html>Everything To Know About The Women He Loved Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./everything-to-know-about-the-women-he-loved-hollywood-life.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
