<time>05 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Owing to <a href=# data-type=post_tag data-id=1353>Elijah Blue Allman’s</a> purported recent drug abuse problems, Cher has requested conservatorship over him.</p><p>The singer and actress, 77, is requesting to be the only conservator of her son’s estate, arguing that he is “substantially unable to manage his financial resources,” according to documents filed in Los Angeles Superior Court.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>A conservator is “urgently needed… to protect Elijah’s property from loss or injury,” according to the document, even though he is expected to receive trust assets before the end of the year.</p><p>This is because Elijah is “currently unable to manage his assets due to severe mental health and substance abuse issues.”&nbsp;</p><p>The document also claims that because of “their tumultuous relationship, which has been marked by a cycle of drug addiction and mental health crises,” his estranged wife Marieangela King is unfit to act as his conservator.</p><p>The document goes on to say, “Elijah is entitled to regular distributions from the Trust. <a href=# data-type=post_tag data-id=1353>Cher</a> is concerned that any funds that are distributed to Elijah will be used for drugs right away, depriving him of the means to support himself and endangering his life.” “Elijah continues to struggle with substance abuse and mental health issues.”</p><p>The Moonstruck actress has allegedly “worked tirelessly to get Elijah into treatment and get him the help he needs,” according to the filing’s conclusion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/peepswiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Cher-and-Elijah-Blue-Allman-1024x576.jpg><p>According to the filing, “[Cher] loves Elijah immensely and has always acted with his best interests in mind.” However, she has not been able to “discuss his preferences concerning the appointment of a temporary conservator” because of his “current mental and physical health issues.”</p><p>Comment requests were answered by Cher’s representative. The current schedule is for a hearing on a permanent order on March 6, 2024, and a hearing on a temporary order on January 5, 2024.</p><p>After a report surfaced in October claiming that she had hired four men to forcibly remove her son from a New York City hotel room in November 2022, Cher finally spoke out about Elijah’s ordeal and her relationship with her 47-year-old son.</p><p>King asserted this in recently discovered divorce documents that she filed in December of last year.</p><p>Cher responded to the accusations by saying, “That rumor is not true,” but she would not elaborate.</p><p>She did, however, affirm that her son’s addiction problems—which he has been transparent about over the years—were connected to a personal family issue.</p><p>Cher remarked, “I am not suffering from any problem that millions of people in the United States aren’t,” about her son’s protracted battles with drug addiction. “I am a mother. In one way or another, it is my responsibility to try to assist my kids. You go above and beyond for your kids. Being a mother means that you just lend a helping hand whenever you can. However, even amid heartbreak, there is joy—most of the time, all you can do is smile, love your kids, and do your best to be there for them.”&nbsp;</p><p>King, 36, claimed in the court filings that the famous person paid the men to take Allman—whose father is the late rock musician Gregg Allman—out of their hotel room because they were attempting to “reconcile” their marriage and she was worried about her son’s safety.&nbsp;</p><p>King, who goes by Queenie, claimed that they had spent “12 days alone together from November 18-November 30 working on their marriage” in New York at the time of the incident.</p><p>In the documents, she added, “One of the four men who took [Allman]” told her they worked for the Grammy winner.&nbsp;</p><p>Cher insisted that she would be there for her children, no matter what. In October, she claimed that I had no parenting experience. “I just keep trying,”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolZq9tMPIs2Wcp51kuaLAxKyrZqCfqXyktMSrqmabn6PApr7VmquoqqOdtrF5wKmnpaGTlsGqu81mqZqho5rAbq%2FOp5qeqp5is7C%2BjJ6joqKRnXqjuNSeZJqknKKur7%2BMsJylpF2Xsqq6xmg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcher-s-conservatorship-application-raises-concern-for-elijah-blue-allman-s-well-being.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcher-s-conservatorship-application-raises-concern-for-elijah-blue-allman-s-well-being.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcher-s-conservatorship-application-raises-concern-for-elijah-blue-allman-s-well-being.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcher-s-conservatorship-application-raises-concern-for-elijah-blue-allman-s-well-being.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcher-s-conservatorship-application-raises-concern-for-elijah-blue-allman-s-well-being.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcher-s-conservatorship-application-raises-concern-for-elijah-blue-allman-s-well-being.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./christian-laettner-age-net-worth-bio-wiki-kids-wife-weight.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./christian-laettner-age-net-worth-bio-wiki-kids-wife-weight.html>Christian Laettner Age, Net worth: Bio-Wiki, Kids, Wife, Weight</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./morning-show-viewers-cringe-at-jennifer-aniston-s-face.html>'Morning Show' viewers cringe at Jennifer Aniston's face</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./morning-show-viewers-cringe-at-jennifer-aniston-s-face.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
