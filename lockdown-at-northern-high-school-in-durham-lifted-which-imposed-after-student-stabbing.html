The incident unfolded just before 11 a.m., prompting swift action from law enforcement and school officials.</p><p>Authorities indicated that a confrontation escalated into a fight at the school, during which one individual is believed to have used a knife to stab at least one other person. Durham Sheriff Clarence Birkhead confirmed that at least one person sustained injuries and required hospital treatment. Several individuals were apprehended for questioning in connection with the incident, but details regarding the number of participants and their student status remain unconfirmed.</p><p>The investigation into the incident is ongoing, with authorities working to piece together the events leading up to the altercation.</p><p>Northern High School, part of Durham Public Schools, resumed normal operations around 1 p.m., with students and staff returning to their routines.</p><p>Durham County Sheriff Clarence Birkhead acknowledged the unfortunate nature of the incident and assured the community of the school’s commitment to safety. He emphasized that schools are not immune to such incidents and stressed the importance of vigilance and preparedness.</p><p>“Kids are safe here at Northern,” Birkhead said. “We’re going to continue to work together and continue to be prepared because these things will happen, unfortunately. Schools are not immune to violence or any incident of this nature. So that is why it is important that we ensure our public and our parents and our students that we are going to do everything that we can to make sure that they are safe.”</p><p>Aerial footage from Chopper 11 showed a visible police presence at the school, including State Highway Patrol cruisers, Durham County Sheriff’s Office vehicles, and an ambulance.</p><p>Northern High School is Durham Public Schools’ newest addition and recently opened its doors to students. The school’s opening had been delayed due to issues with its backflow preventer and severe weather conditions.</p><p>Despite ongoing work on the school’s auditorium and athletic fields, school officials stressed that these areas were not required for occupancy by students and staff.</p><p>The incident has left the community shaken, and parents were seen at the school to pick up their children as soon as the lockdown was lifted. Some students expressed their reluctance to return to the school after the incident, while parents praised the administrators and authorities for their swift response.</p><p>Sheriff Birkhead assured that there was no ongoing threat to the community or students, emphasizing the quick response of student resource officers and police officers in neutralizing the situation.</p><p>A separate crash outside the school was reported, though it remains unclear if it was related to the lockdown incident.</p><p>Northern High School, which had just opened its doors on September 5, continues to provide support and counseling to students and staff affected by the incident as they grapple with the aftermath of this unfortunate event.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51kubCvyp2msKZdlsFuus6rq6GdoqN6qbXGoWSsm5ikvK15yKdkna2ina6uecuina2dlGLEqbXCoWSipaCkwKawjJqdrZ2iYsC1wcOepa1lo6muo67Ip55o</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flockdown-at-northern-high-school-in-durham-lifted-which-imposed-after-student-stabbing.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flockdown-at-northern-high-school-in-durham-lifted-which-imposed-after-student-stabbing.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flockdown-at-northern-high-school-in-durham-lifted-which-imposed-after-student-stabbing.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flockdown-at-northern-high-school-in-durham-lifted-which-imposed-after-student-stabbing.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flockdown-at-northern-high-school-in-durham-lifted-which-imposed-after-student-stabbing.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flockdown-at-northern-high-school-in-durham-lifted-which-imposed-after-student-stabbing.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./michael-spinks-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./michael-spinks-net-worth.html>Michael Spinks Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./elon-musk-goes-shirtless-on-a-yacht-in-mykonos-photos-hollywood-life.html>Elon Musk Goes Shirtless On A Yacht In Mykonos: Photos Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./elon-musk-goes-shirtless-on-a-yacht-in-mykonos-photos-hollywood-life.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
