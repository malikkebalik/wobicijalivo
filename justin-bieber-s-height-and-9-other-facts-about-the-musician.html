For more exciting details like this and more, read on.</span></p><h3><strong>Profile Summary of Justin Bieber</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name</strong> – Justin Drew Bieber</li><li><strong>Age</strong> – 29</li><li><strong>Date of Birth</strong> – March 1st, 1994</li><li><strong>Place of Birth</strong> – London, Ontario, Canada.</li><li><strong>Nationality</strong> – Canadian</li><li><strong>Height</strong> – 5 feet 7 inches or 1.70 m</li><li><strong>Weight</strong> – 66kg or 145.5 lbs</li><li><strong>Chest</strong> – 42 inches (107 cm)</li><li><strong>Biceps</strong> – 14.5 inches (37cm)</li><li><strong>Waist</strong> – 32 inches (81 cm)</li><li><strong>Father</strong> – Jeremy Bieber</li><li><strong>Mother</strong> – Pattie Mallette</li><li><strong>Siblings</strong> – Jazmyn, Jaxon, and Bay (half-siblings) and Allie (stepsister)</li><li><strong>Wife</strong> – Hailey Bieber</li><li><strong>Education (schools attended)</strong> – St. Michael Catholic Secondary School</li><li><strong>Net Worth</strong> – $285 million</li></ul><h2><strong>1. Justin Bieber Is 5 Feet 7 Inches or 1.70 m Tall</strong></h2><p>Justin Bieber has witnessed controversies in several areas of his life and one of them is his height. A 2012 GQ interview has it that the singer is 5 feet 9 inches or 1.75 m tall. He is also listed as 5 feet 9 inches tall on <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">his driver’s license</a>. Many people find this hard to believe given that he appears shorter than people who are confirmed to be about 5 feet 8 inches tall. Investigations and comparisons have been done and the consensus is that Justin Bieber is 5 feet 7 inches tall. This will make him half an inch shorter than his wife, Hailey Bieber, who is 5 feet 7 ½ inches or 1.71 m tall.</p><h2><strong>2. He Is The Youngest Soloist To Chart 100 Songs On The Billboard Hot 100</strong></h2><p>Justin Bieber blazed a trail in his career at an early age and today, he has broken over 35 world records. In July 2021, he once more made history as the youngest solo musician to have had 100 of his songs chart on the Billboard Hot 100. He achieved this feat at the age of 27 years, four months, and three days, thus surpassing Drake who tallied his 100th entry on the Billboard Hot 100 at the age of 28 years, 11 months, and two weeks old.</p><h2><strong>3. His Father is a Former MMA Fighter-Turned-Carpenter</strong></h2><p>The story of Justin Bieber’s background is one that is well told. His parents, Pattie and Jeremy, had him barely out of high school and found it hard raising him. Jeremy would often leave for months on end and it fell to his <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>mother</a>, Pattie, to raise her son most of the time. Despite this, Bieber maintains a good relationship with his dad and frequently posts heartwarming tributes to him. Jeremy Bieber is an avid MMA fan and once had a spell as a Muay Thai fighter. He is now retired and works in construction as a carpenter.</p><h2><strong>4. Justin Bieber is Pretty Smart and Graduated School With a 4.0 GPA</strong></h2><p>Thanks to the pressures of growing up in the spotlight, Justin Bieber has done stuff that would have you questioning his intelligence. The fact remains that the Sorry crooner is pretty book smart. Bieber can solve a Rubik’s cube in about two minutes. He also graduated high school with a pretty high GPA despite combining school with his burgeoning career.</p><h2><strong>5. He Used To Busk On The Streets Of Ontario As A Teen</strong></h2><p>Given the gazillion awards and album sales to his name, one would find it hard to believe the humble origins of Justin Bieber’s career. Having proven his musical talent by winning a local singing completion in 2007, a 13-year old Bieber spent the summer busking in front of the local theater in his hometown. He had his grandparents keeping watch from a safe distance and would pocket about <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">$150 to $200</a> each day, such a far cry from the singer that regularly features on the Forbes highest earning celebrities list and makes up to $80 million per annum.</p><h2><strong>6. He Once Had A Nail Polish Line To His Name</strong></h2><p>Justin Bieber has dabbled into several profitable ventures in the course of his career, including a clothing line, a crocs line, and a fragrance line. The Biebs also launched a nail polish line titled the One Less Lonely Girl Collection back in 2010. It was of course snapped up by his massive legion of teen fans, both male and female alike, and it sold one million bottles in just two months of existence.</p><h2><strong>7. Justin Bieber is Left-Handed</strong></h2><p>Justin Bieber is naturally left-handed and so when he first started playing the guitar, he had to turn it back as it was a right-handed guitar. This made it difficult for him but his mom later got him a left-handed guitar as a birthday gift.</p><p>Bieber is not the only celebrity who is left-handed. Others are Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lawrence, Paul McCartney, Will Ferrell, Mark Wahlberg, and Anna Kendrick.</p><h2><strong>8. He Has A Dedicated Exhibit At The Stratford Perth Museum, Ontario</strong></h2><p>Still doubting the extent of Justin Bieber’s fame? Well, the singer has a thriving exhibit dedicated to him at the local museum in his hometown. The exhibit features personal mementos and paraphernalia from both his present and past years, including his old sneakers, his high school diploma, and the gift bag that he and his wife, Hailey, gave out during their wedding. The museum attracts tens of thousands of visitors each year, including Bieber himself who has been there about five times.</p><h2><strong>9. His Favorite Food is Spaghetti Bolognese</strong></h2><p>Back in a 2010 interview, Justin Bieber disclosed that his favorite food is <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Spaghetti Bolognese</a>. He also went on to reveal that his favorite color is purple and that he is a big fan of hockey (which doesn’t come as a surprise given that he is Canadian). Of course, a decade has passed since then and Bieber’s taste in food may have changed. One thing that remains constant though is his love for hockey.</p><h2><strong>10. The Singer is Banned From Playing in China</strong></h2><p>The Chinese authorities are famous for their strict rules and one person that has been caught up in it is Justin Bieber. The singer had previously performed there on one occasion. Then, in 2017, Beijing’s culture bureau announced that they were banning him from performing in the country because of his bad behavior. They described him as a gifted but controversial young singer and expressed hope that he would continue to improve his words and actions as he matures with age. It is not certain whether the ban is still in place but in May 2021, Chinese authorities <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">removed scenes</a> featuring Bieber from the reunion of the hit American show, Friends. This indicates that they have not entirely let him off the hook.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunC21KyroqZdl7amrsSrZKGdmZy1tXnWnqCgoKRisKmx0q1kmqaUYsCpu8RmqqKylWQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjustin-bieber-s-height-and-9-other-facts-about-the-musician.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjustin-bieber-s-height-and-9-other-facts-about-the-musician.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjustin-bieber-s-height-and-9-other-facts-about-the-musician.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjustin-bieber-s-height-and-9-other-facts-about-the-musician.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjustin-bieber-s-height-and-9-other-facts-about-the-musician.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjustin-bieber-s-height-and-9-other-facts-about-the-musician.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./mia-malkova-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./mia-malkova-net-worth.html>Mia Malkova Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./deb-ellman-watson-obituary-honoring-a-life-of-service-and-visionary-legacy.html>Deb Ellman Watson Obituary: Honoring a Life of Service and Visionary Legacy</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./deb-ellman-watson-obituary-honoring-a-life-of-service-and-visionary-legacy.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
