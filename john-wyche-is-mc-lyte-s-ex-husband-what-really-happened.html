This comes just three years after Lyte filed for divorce owing to irreconcilable differences in 2020, as previously stated.</p><p>The divorce took three years to finalize, and as a result, the media continued to spread stories that Lyte’s ex-husband was trying to take a cut of her fortune. However, the rapper and entrepreneur cleared the air in a January 2023 Instagram post, accusing the media of exploiting her divorce for click baits and views. She insisted that her ex-husband made no attempt to seize her assets before, during, or after their marriage.</p><p>She said the divorce was delayed because her ex-husband was trying to preserve their marriage.</p><p>Wyche’s ex-wife took advantage of the situation to advise individuals contemplating marriage to obtain a prenuptial agreement in order to avoid conflict in the event of divorce. She also advised people to protect their entire properties through good insurance, and financial, and estate planning.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Lyte is keeping her whole assets</a>, including her music catalog. This is feasible since she and her ex-husband signed a prenuptial agreement prior to their August 2017 wedding.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiipaCyo8HGrGWcp51kt7C0zWauspuYmnqur4ylsK2do2KyuXnHrqqbmZ6Zeqmtz6mcp52UZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjohn-wyche-is-mc-lyte-s-ex-husband-what-really-happened.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjohn-wyche-is-mc-lyte-s-ex-husband-what-really-happened.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjohn-wyche-is-mc-lyte-s-ex-husband-what-really-happened.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjohn-wyche-is-mc-lyte-s-ex-husband-what-really-happened.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjohn-wyche-is-mc-lyte-s-ex-husband-what-really-happened.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjohn-wyche-is-mc-lyte-s-ex-husband-what-really-happened.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./megan-telles-married-to-her-husband-who-is-her-husband-when-did-they-got-married.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./megan-telles-married-to-her-husband-who-is-her-husband-when-did-they-got-married.html>Megan Telles Married to her Husband; Who is her Husband?
